### 👨‍💻 About Me  

I’m a Computer Science student at TU Delft who’s passionate about building tech that actually makes a difference — especially where **sustainability, nature, and innovation** meet.  

Long-term, I see myself as a **Tech Lead / Solutions Architect**, leading the design of systems that optimise and improve the way things work — whether that’s smarter farming 🌱 or safer autonomous driving.

For now, I’m focused on **getting my hands dirty**: solving tough problems, working in collaborative teams, and learning as much as possible from real projects.  

Some of the areas I’m most curious about right now:  
- Tech for nature & sustainability
- Robotics and AI optimisation
- Systems thinking & problem solving
