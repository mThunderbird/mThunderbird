### 🧭 About Me

I'm a first-year Computer Science and Engineering student at TU Delft, passionate about using technology to **solve real-world problems** — especially those at the intersection of **nature, sustainability, and innovation**.

My vision for my future career is to design and build systems that optimise and enhance existing processes — whether it's improving how we grow tomatoes 🌱 or streamlining how people interact with tech.

💡 I am interested in:
- Tech-for-nature & sustainability
- Systems thinking & problem-solving
- Algorithms, optimisation, and infrastructure
- Creative tools & web applications
