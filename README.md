My name is Dragostin Ivanov from Bulgaria, 
currently a first year Computer Science Bachelor at TU\Delft

I'm interested in AI, Cybersecurity, and Robotics. I'm looking forward to working
on interesting collaborative projects!

âš¡ Fun fact: I went to a Robotoics workshop to create a very simple flipperbot. It was awesome!!!
